Twitter for Windows
===================

This project was conceived after using the very nice Twitter for Mac client on OS X.  It aims to replicate the look and feel of that app in a Windows environment.  Currently, no officially supported Twitter client exists for Windows - this project tries to fill that gap.

Building tfwin
--------------

Twitter for Windows uses the .NET framework 4 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  Open /Source/Twitter.sln in Visual Studio, then Build -> Build Solution.

To build the installer, you will need the [Inno Setup Compiler].  Open /Installer/twitter-windows.iss in Inno, then Build -> Compile.  The resulting executable will be located at /Installer/bin/twitter\_setup\_x.x.x.exe.
